It's a python project which records  and provides student data.
The Student Record Management System is a computer program that helps schools or educational institutions keep track of their students' information. It's like a digital notebook where all student details are stored and can be easily accessed whenever needed.
What It Does:
•	Accept Student Data: With this system, you can add new student information, such as their name, roll number, and subject-wise marks. Just like writing down details in a book.
•	Display Student Data: It can show you a list of all the students and their information, like a report card for everyone.
•	Delete Student Data: If a student leaves or you need to remove their information, the system helps you delete it, just like tearing a page out of a notebook.
•	Search for a Student: If you want to find a specific student, you can search by their roll number, and it will show you all their details.
•	Easy to Use: You don't need to be a computer expert to use it. It's like using a simple menu with options, just like in a restaurant.
